relationship between lifestyle, health, demographic factors, and sleep quality. Your goal is to identify factors that correlate with poor sleep health.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- Examine relationships between several factors like gender, occupation, physical activity, stress levels, and sleep quality/duration. Create visualizations to present your findings.\n- Produce recommendations on ways people can improve sleep health based on the patterns in the data.\n- Develop an accessible summary of study findings and recommendations for improving sleep health for non-technical audiences.","metadata":{},"id":"6c0744d0","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## 🧑‍⚖️ Judging criteria\n\nThis competition is for helping to understand how competitions work.
